## Analysis and Recommendations 

### Which survey questions did respondents agree/disagree with most?

Highest Agreement:
-	“I know what is expected of me at work.”
-	“My supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about me as a person.”
-	“My department is inclusive and demonstrates support of a diverse workforce.”
  
Lowest Agreement:
-	“I have a best friend at work.”
-	“In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work.”
-	“My supervisor holds employees accountable for performance.”
  
This indicates clarity of job responsibilities but dissatisfaction with recognition and workplace relationships.

### Patterns or Trends by Department/Role

By Department:
-	Some departments like Family Justice Center and Medical Examiner’s Office showed very low response or engagement.
-	Departments such as Parks and Recreation and Emergency Management had relatively higher engagement across roles.
  
By Role:
-	Directors show the lowest engagement and lowest agreement levels.
-	Supervisors have the highest response rates, suggesting stronger involvement.
-	Staff and Managers fall in between.

### Steps Employers Can Take to Improve Satisfaction

Target Low-Scoring Departments and Roles: Focus on Director-level employees and departments with low engagement (Family Justice, Medical Examiner). Investigate why participation is low.

Enhance Recognition Programs: Employees feel a lack of recognition. Introduce reward systems, peer-nomination programs, and regular acknowledgment of performance.

Improve Workplace Relationships: Promote team-building activities, mentorship programs, and cross-department collaboration to strengthen workplace friendships.

Leadership Development: Provide training and support for Directors and Managers to improve communication, recognition practices, and engagement with their teams.

Address Job Satisfaction Concerns: Collect qualitative feedback (focus groups, follow-up surveys) to understand specific dissatisfaction drivers (e.g., workload, compensation, career growth).


## Conclusion
The employee survey reveals strong clarity in work expectations but highlights significant weaknesses in recognition, job satisfaction, and workplace friendships. Addressing these gaps through leadership development, recognition programs, and targeted support for low-engagement departments will enhance overall employee satisfaction and organizational performance.
